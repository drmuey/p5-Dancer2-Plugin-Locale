=head1 NAME

Dancer2::Plugin::Locale - Localize your Dancer2 application

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Dancer2::Plugin::Locale version 0.06

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your app:

    use Dancer2;
    use Dancer2::Plugin::Locale;

    …
        locale->maketext('You are [numf,_1] of [numf,_2].', 42, 99);
    …

and from template

    <div id="req_msg">[% locale.maketext('You have [quant,_1,request,requests].', req_count) %]</div>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds a C<locale> keyword for your code and templates.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 locale

A lazy façade to get a locale handle suitable to the request. The locale object is a CLDR aware maketext format object.

It will be based on the session’s locale value if possible, then a configured default if possible, then 'en'.

=head2 The object, in more detail

The object is L<Locale::Maketext::Utils> based.

L<Locale::Maketext::Utils> extends L<Locale::Maketext> a number of ways including:

=over 4

=item * It shifts toward CLDR based functionality which means you no longer have to create locale specific variants of code in each locale’s class.

=item * Because of that and other utils it has, creating and dealing with the locale subclasses classes is much easier.

=item * The object is a multiton (AKA an argument based singleton):  L<Locale::Maketext::Utils/"Argument based singleton">

=item * Adds a number of helpful methods: L<Locale::Maketext::Utils/METHODS>

=item * More sane fallback and lookup failure hooks: L<Locale::Maketext::Utils/"Automatically _AUTO'd Failure Handling with hooks">

=item * Adds a very handy set of bracket notation methods (CLDR when possible)  L</"Bracket Notation">

=head3 Available Locales

The locales available are determined by the lexicon files found in the appdir’s C<locale/> directory.

The name of each file must be a normalized version (See Locales::normalize_tag() in L<Locales>) of an L<acceptable ISO tag|Locales/"Supported_Locale_Criteria">. and end in with the extension C<.json>.

Tip: To make them available to your UI you could simply symlink C<…/locale/> to C<…/public/locale>.

=head3 Lexicon

A lexicon is a simple key/value hash  where the key is the phrase and the value is the translation.

For example,in pseudo code:

    # source phrase => target phrase
    'Hello World' => 'Bonjour Monde'

Each locale will have a lexicon hash in a file as desrcibed in L</"Available Locales">.

The hash must be written in JSON format and be utf8 encoded.

Don’t be afraid of non-ASCII characters, just put them in the file as the character and it will work fine (if it doesn’t then it can help you track down bugs faster, win win!).

    "I ♥︎ Dancer2!" : "私は♥︎ダンサー2"

=head3 Bracket Notation

Bracket notation is described a bit more at L<Locale::Maketext/BRACKET NOTATION> but is essentially a format to allow you to notate–within left and right square brackets, hence the name–dynamic portions of a phrase.

For example, include a non-translatable ever-changing name:

    locale->maketext('Your email address, [_1], has been unsubscribed.', $email)

or a number formatted according to the object’s locale’s CLDR data:

    locale->maketext('You are user [numf,_1] of [numf,_2].', $place, $count)

The bracket notation improvements over the core L<Locale::Maketext> can be categoraized as follows:

=over 4

=item * L<additional bracket notation methods|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Locale::Maketext::Utils#Additional_bracket_notation_methods>

=item * L<output() bracket notation methods|http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Locale::Maketext::Utils#output()>

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 Errors

If the C<locale/> directory exists but can not be opened:

C<<Could not read locale directory (%s): $!>>

=head2 Warnings

If you have a mis-named file in your C<locale/> directory:

C<<Skipping un-normalized locale named lexicon (%s.json) …>>

If you have a properly named lexicon that is not a file in your C<locale/> directory:

C<<Skipping non-file lexicon (%s.json) …>>

If you have a lexicon that can’t be loaded (e.g. broken JSON):

C<<Ignoring lexicon, %s, since it containes invalid JSON:\n\t$@>>

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

The default locale is “en”, you can change it via Dancer2 configuration like so:

    plugins:
      Locales:
        default_locale: ja
